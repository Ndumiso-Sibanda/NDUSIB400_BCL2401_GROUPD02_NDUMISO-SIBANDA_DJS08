VanLife Project
Introduction
The VanLife Project is a single-page application (SPA) built using React and React Router. It simulates a van rental service platform where users can view available vans, read detailed information about each van, and host their own vans for rent. The application also includes user authentication, nested routing, and dynamic route parameters.

Improvements Implemented
Authentication Simulation:

A mock authentication function loginUser was implemented to allow any email and password combination to simulate a login process. This helps in testing and demonstrating the login functionality without a backend.
Nested Routes:

Nested routes were utilized to organize the host-related pages under a single HostLayout. This improves the modularity and readability of the code.
Route Parameters:

Route parameters were implemented for detailed views of vans. This allows dynamic URL segments and easy access to specific van details using the useParams hook.
Dynamic Linking and Navigation:

The <Link> and <NavLink> components were used for navigation, enhancing the SPA experience by preventing full page reloads and enabling active styling.
What I Learned
Setting Up React Router:

Learned how to set up React Router using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components to define navigation structure.
Handling Route Parameters:

Understood how to use route parameters and the useParams hook to access dynamic values from the URL.
Implementing Nested Routes:

Gained experience in implementing nested routes to create a hierarchical and organized routing structure.
Simulating Authentication:

Learned how to simulate authentication by creating a mock login function that always resolves successfully.
